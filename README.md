All code is located in code.ts

Discussion:
I used ?? Infinity to bypass the possibility of the key value pair being undefined in the map, and if it isnt in the map it just gets sorted to the end of the answer.
I put some assumptions I had in the comments in code.ts, but some thing that could be expanded on but I thought was beyond the scope of the challenge was verfiying the customAlphabet input, like ensuring it is 26 characters, all unique, and from the alphabet.

Run the code:

1. clone the project
2. run "npm install" to install dependencies
3. run code with "npm start"
